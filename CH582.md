### Pinouts reverse engineering

### Chip configuration

### Bootloader

To enter bootloader, you have to press the bottom button when plugging USB.

The bootloader will remain active for few seconds, waiting for upload.

Important: Because the badge reassigns the bootloader pin as GPIO after boot,
it is impossible to switch to bootloader as long as the battery is connected
to the board (the board is always powered and does not reset). To be able to
access the bootloader you must then desolder the battery.
